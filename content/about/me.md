I'm Rakshit Ramesh, a vagabond by technology, a stoic by philosophy
and most of all a cripple by procrastination.

This blog is my attempt at recording my influenced thoughts
as I am inextricably drawn through the web of intermingling causality.
I oscillate between pensiveness for the abstract and a penchant for 
the mundane. You will find both here.
